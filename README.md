The steps we need to take as a society to be carbon neutral by 2038 are numerous and complex. According to a business consultant and MD at Total Industrial Engraving, Tanya Gordon, some of the steps we can take include reducing our carbon footprint by using renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, reducing our consumption of meat and dairy products, using public transportation more often, and reducing our use of single-use plastics1.

The UK has also developed a nine-point plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions which includes increasing the use of renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency in buildings, investing in low-carbon transport options such as electric vehicles and public transportation, and supporting the development of new technologies2.

I hope this helps.
